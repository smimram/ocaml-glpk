## Dependencies

To build this library you need to have OCaml 3.07, `dune`, and glpk installed.

You can download glpk here: http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html.


## Installation

To compile the program type:

```
make
```

then, to install it, type (possibly as root):

```
make install
```


## Notes

The bindings are not (yet) complete. If you need a specific function, just mail
me (or send a patch) and I'll add it as soon as possible.


## License

The license of this library is the GPL like the original glpk library. It is
therefore useless to ask me to change the license, I can't do that.
